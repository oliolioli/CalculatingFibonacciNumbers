# CalculatingFibonacciNumbers
Calculating Fibonacci numbers with Assembler (RISC-V)


This program can calculate the first 30 [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) with recursive functions. It takes a simple input for the desired Fibonacci number and prints some nice resulting output.

Programmed with [**Linux syscalls**](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/RISC-V-Linux/blob/13cb16d5e8e11ebca490cad50cc5abbd222839a1/linux/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h) and may have to be changed on other operating systems.

Compiled and debugged with [RARS -- RISC-V Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars).
